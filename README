SWMM CMS
========

A simple Django based CMS for your favourite collection(s).

Summary
-------

An online exposition that shows a friend's complete Star Wars Micro Machines 
collection. It has four tabs home, about, comment and contact.

The home tab shows directly the galleries, which are put into episodes. A 
gallery is a series of images with a leading portrait displaying a Star Wars 
figure or vehicle from a particular episode.

If an image is clicked on it's zoomed and on a second click it shrinks back 
to its original size. Each image (except the first portrait) can be rated. 
Further there is an information icon, which leads to an extra view with 
further information about the related Micro Machine.

The about tab displays my friend - the collection owner - there is the 
possibility to make comments in the next tab, and contact him using the last 
tab.
